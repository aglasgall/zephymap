Version 0.0.2

Pronounced /'zɛfiːmæp/ or ZE-fee-map.

This requires python-zephyr, which you can get via

git checkout git://github.com/ebroder/python-zephyr.git

or

http://github.com/ebroder/python-zephyr/downloads

for stable tagged builds. This will require libzephyr-dev, which
may or may not in turn require comerr-dev.

To set up, create a configuration file named .zephymap.conf in your home directory
of the format:

[zephyr]
recipient: phurst
[mailbox 1]
server: imap.foo.com
username: username1
password: password1
[Mailbox 2]
server: imap.baz.com
username: username2
password: password2
ssl: true


note that SSL will default to being enabled. option names are case-insensitive,
but the special section zephyr must be capitalized as such. there is also the
optional class setting in the zephyr section, which configures the class that you
will receive mail in. It defaults to MAIL.

The regex option in the zephyr section will be matched against the entire folder name;
depending on your IMAP server, subfolders may be separated with /, ., or something
even more exotic. Gmail uses / (e.g., Lists/Reuse); I think MIT uses . (e.g., SIPB.private)
Note that you can always just zpunt instances for mailboxes that you don't care about;
this is probably better if you only have one instance/folder that you don't care about.
Similarly, only subscribing to a specific instance might be easier to manage, as well as
dynamically changeable (there is currently no way to tell zephymap to reload its config file.)
