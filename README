Pronounced /'zɛfiːmæp/ or ZE-fee-map.

This requires python-zephyr, which you can get via

git checkout git://github.com/ebroder/python-zephyr.git

or alternately, via

easy_install PyZephyr

To set up, create a configuration file of the format:

[Global]
recipient: phurst
[mailbox 1]
server: imap.foo.com
username: username1
password: password1
[Mailbox 2]
server: imap.baz.com
username: username2
password: password2
ssl: true


note that SSL will default to being disabled. option names are case-insensitive,
but the special section Global must be capitalized as such. there is also the
optional class setting in the Global section, which configures the class that you
will receive mail in. It defaults to MAIL.
